<h1>Introduction to Javascript Task</h1>
</div>


>## Brief

    
<br>

- Build a basic arithmetic calculator without a frontend

- The calculator should be able to perform basic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, & Division

<br>


#

>## Solution

- Created a function with javascript that prompts a user to enter operations to add, divide, subtract and multiply two numbers.

- If the user inputs an invalid operator, an alert is shown and the prompt to enter an operator keeps reappearing until a valid input is received.
